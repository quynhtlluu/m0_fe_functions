# Self Evaluation

**- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?**

I definitely need to improve my time management skills. I have spent too much time today not really focusing on the material that is soon approaching a deadline. One tip I have is to never be afraid to look for help elsewhere when you need it. Also if you're ever in a state of focus, don't try to get out of it if possible. Breaks can help a lot for sure will getting focused if you feel out of it. However, deadlines are not going to budge and it's important to be mindful of what benefits to gain from getting something out of the way sooner than later.

**- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?**

A 'function' is a command that you can write onto your computer program to get it to do something for you. Inside a function are 'parameters' that are character traits that we assign value to. For example, if a person writing a paper were a function, how long their writing is might be a parameter. An argument is the information needed to make a function work. An example of an argument might be the steps you would need to write a paper, like choosing what to write about, choosing where you might write something and so on.

**- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.**

Parameters are like variables you would store in a function. That could be the genre of a book if someone wanted to read a book. Arguments are the series of commands and definitions within a function that make it work. An argument for a function to read a book might include information about getting access to a book and getting a place to comfortably read a book.

**- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?**

I would like to learn more about how to use a function when building features of a website. In what specific ways do we interact with functions when using a website?
